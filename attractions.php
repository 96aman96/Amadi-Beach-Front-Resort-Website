									<h3>Roam at Tito's Street</h3>
									<p>Goa is India’s favourite party place. Therefore, you simply have to visit one of the many clubs scattered around Goa on your visit there. Tito’s Street is one of the best clubs you can visit. Tito’s Street, named after the street it is located on, is a club that attracts a lot of crowd especially because of its prime location and its top-notch service. Baga beach, where the club is located, is a party hub so it is no wonder that loads of tourists find their way to Tito’s Street after sundown.

									<h3>
Calangute Beach</h3>
									<p>The largest beach in Goa, Calangute Beach is also affectionately known as the “Queen of Beaches”. It is among the top ten beaches in the world, which means it is one of the tourist places in Goa that you should not miss. It is a big, serene beach with activities enough to fill your mind for the entirety of your trip. The beach alone is a great attraction for tourists. The beach is ideal for both the options,  lying down in the sand without the fear of being run over or trying your hand at some water sports.

									<h3>Dudhsagar Waterfalls</h3>
									<p>The Dudhsagar Waterfalls are situated on the Goa-Karnataka border and are one of India’s must-see sights. The four-tiered waterfall structure is one of the tallest in India and is located on the Mandovi River. The white water cascades down from a height of nearly 1017 feet off a nearly steep mountain face. They form a part of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, so the best way to reach them is by entering the national park and taking a van allocated by the park to the falls.

									<h3>The Church of Our Lady</h3>
									<p>This is one of the most frequented places for sightseeing in Goa. The lovely church which stands tall in the capital city of Goa has had a long tryst with the past. It was first built as a chapel in 1541. Over this chapel, the larger building of the church was then constructed in 1619. It has since undergone many revisions, but the original building has remained. It draws devotees from all over the globe and has been a spiritual and geographical landmark for centuries.

									<h3>Candolim Beach</h3>
									<p>Running from Calangute Beach on one side to Fort Aguada on the other is the Candolim Beach. The day activities offered on this beach are its best attraction. You can perform a whole host of activities on the beach including a vast array of water sports, all at very reasonable prices. You can choose to spend some time at Candolim Beach and then head over to Calangute next door or just spend all your day on this beach and explore the sights nearby.

									<h3>Sinquerim Beach</h3>
									<p>This beach is connected to the Candolim Beach and Fort Aguada guards one end of its shore. As a result, the tourist attractions here are pretty much the same as those in Candolim. You can explore the Old Fort and the lighthouse that stands within the fort, enjoy the sunset from the fort or simply watch the waves crash on the seashore during high tide. One difference between the two beaches is that Sinquerium Beach can easily take home the prize for being the quieter and the cleaner between the two beaches.
